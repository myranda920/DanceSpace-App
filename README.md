Live Link [Dance Space](Dance Space - A Dance Style Informational ).

Dance Space is an application where users can find information about a particular dance genre. A user starts by reading some information about the website and about the types or training and careers one can get from taking dance classes. 

After this, they can choose from a drop down of dance styles. Once chosen, a small informational blurb taken from wikipedia will display along with three youtube videos showing demonstrations of the style. These videos mix from a range of beggining level to advanced dancers. 

For someone who is interested in dance, it can be tough to know exactly what information to look for. This app helps provide it to be easier then having to go through many google searches.
